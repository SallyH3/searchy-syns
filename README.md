# Searchy Syns

## Abstract:

As my final project at Turing School of Software & Design, we were given a take home challenge to create a single-page application (using the Merriam-Webster Thesaurus API) in Vue.js that allows users to find synonyms for a word they search. This was my very first exposure to Vue.js and we were given instruction to complete this project without any Vue lessons and completely solo (no pairing/additional guidance).

## Project setup:

```
npm install
```

## Run on your server:

```
npm run serve
```
